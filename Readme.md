Data Mining project, UIC - CS583 - Professor: Bing Liu.

## Abstract
In this project we propose an approach for sentiment
analysis classification based on Twitter posts. The chosen
approach embeds data analysis, preprocessing and feature
extraction to better characterize the data. The solution
compares different classification models to get the best possible
result.
